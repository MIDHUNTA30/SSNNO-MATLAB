This work presents a State-Space Neural Network with Ordered variance (SSNNO) in which the state variables are ordered in decreasing variance. A systematic way of model order reduction with SSNNO is proposed, which leads to a Reduced order SSNNO (R-SSNNO). The effectiveness of SSNNO in identifying reduced-order state-space models is illustrated using simulations on a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process example. Further, the extension of SSNNO in control: Model Predictive Control (MPC) and state estimation: Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is illustrated using the CSTR example.
